# MODULE 11 - UFO SIGHTINGS

# OVERVIEW 
The UFO challenge was a chance to create a HTML page with a table that would update based on filter inputs that we created.  The table of UFO sightings has inputs for the date, city, state, country, shape (of UFO), duration of sighting and comments.  The filters we created are for the date, city, state, country and shape.  
  

# RESULTS
    
Overall Results:   
    The result of the base HTML page shows the entirety of the table information with filters that ask for the variable to filter.  Each filter will only take the specified variable that it is asking, as in if you enter a country in the state filter it will yield no results.  The filters will also work right away after putting in the specified variable.  Though the filter table button is still at the bottom of the current HTML page there is no need to activate it to adjust the table information.  Lastly with the filters set up as they are now, the variable put into each input space needs to match exactly what the field has.  Example, the table has state abbreviations so if you were to input "texas" instead of "tx" like the table has you will see no results.  




# SUMMARY
One drawback as mentioned above is that the input in each filter needs to match the table variables exactly as listed.  Writing out the state or country instead of the abbreviations will not yield any results.  Also if the table has "st. louis" and you filter for "saint louis" you will also see no results.  The

Two ways to improve upon this table would be to.  One - Create a filter for teh comments section that would filter a comment for anything that contains what is in the filter variable and no just an exact match.  Two - the filter are currently set up so if you input multiple criteria only results that match all criteria will remain showing.  You could create on "or" function that shows the results of any of the filters you input example, circle for a shape "or" in teh city of cary.
